</div>

For the round two of the Web Development Course, I will be composing the start of the landing page for a personal portfolio website that I will add to as time moves on and add more elements. 
<br>
I wanted to make a page whereupon landing you are greeted by a hero image with a call to action and a button that will pull up a contact form popup, after project is graded I will add a backend golang functionality to it.
<br>
 I will add a responsive nav bar at some point as it is not a requirement in this project but I want the nav bar to only be visible upon passing the hero image. 
 <br>
 For now in this project, It will show the different programming languages I know and a progress bar gauging my comfort ability in taking on a project in it. As I dont really see anyone ever really 100% knowing a language since things are ever-changing. 
 <br>
 Next will be some portfolio images of projects I have done before for my associates degree. As I pursue my bachelors I will add more impressive portfolio options and make them have a GitHub button underneath showing my source code. 
 <br>
 After my portfolio images, I will have an API call that will pull my Wordpress blog posts and update it as I post. 
 <br>
 Finally, a footer, with my social media links as buttons.
